#### 4. How often do you use code from stack overflow?

#### 6. Describe specifically the extent of your knowledge and experience with TDD?
> I am familiar with TDD and its principles, but do not generally practice it in my normal workflow. Instead I opt to tweak APIs until they are how I want them, and then write tests to cover all necessary requirements. While I do believe that tests are critical, I do not believe passing tests – regardless if they are correct or not – are solely indicative of effective code. That being said, I certainly understand TDD's value in helping to create an ecosystem of maintainable code, and would be happy to use it if asked.

#### 11. Why should you avoid using jQuery?
> You shouldn't summarily avoid using jQuery. Just like any tool available, it has its strengths, weaknesses, and utility. It's about finding the right tool for the job. If you need light DOM manipulation, there's no reason to pull in a full-blown client-side framework or library like React or Angular. For many websites and use cases jQuery works fine, especially when you consider loading it from a CDN means many users will have it cached, thus avoiding some of the concern with its weight and impact on load times.
