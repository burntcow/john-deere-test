#### 11. Why should you avoid using jQuery?
> You shouldn't summarily avoid using jQuery. Just like any tool available, it has its strengths, weaknesses, and utility. It's about finding the right tool for the job. If you need light DOM manipulation, there's no reason to pull in a full-blown client-side framework or library like React or Angular. For many websites and use cases jQuery works fine, especially when you consider loading it from a CDN means many users will have it cached, thus avoiding some of the concern with its weight and impact on load times.
